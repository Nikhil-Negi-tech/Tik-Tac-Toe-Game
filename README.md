This Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to play against each other. The players take turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
